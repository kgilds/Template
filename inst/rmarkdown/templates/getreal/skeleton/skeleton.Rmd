## Adding an RMarkdown Template

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.

Finally, be sure to remove this message!
